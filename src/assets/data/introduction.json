    "As a student, I developed tools using Python and C++ to contribute to research in medicine and genomics. In the spring of 2016, I graduated from UBC and took a web development position at a growing startup. Over the next year and ten months, I became a key part of the team as an integral member to two greenfield projects. I worked on building an improved e-commerce platform and developing a new major version of the flagship data center infrastructure management software.",
    "I went on the trip of a lifetime to travel Europe starting from February 2018. In the next two and a half months, I visited England, France, Spain, Italy, Germany, many more countries and countless cities. I have since returned to Vancouver, hungry for my next adventure!",
