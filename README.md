# Resume Webpage

My resume and personal website created using Vue.js and Material Design principles. Data is stored in JSON format and imported into each component to separate the content from the view. 

## Live Site

[View resume webpage](https://thepokedexter.github.io/)

## Motivation

As a mostly React and Bootstrap developer, this was a chance for me experiment with Vue.js and Material, and create a demo-able product while I'm at it. Using Git to manage this project allows me to keep my resume up to date more easily. 

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm start

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
